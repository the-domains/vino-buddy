A Vino Buddy(tm) is designed to securely hold wine glasses of various shapes and sizes around your neck. It has been tested in various environments to ensure that it is comfortable and spill-free.

We have styles for both men and women. There are designs that can go with any outfit, or you can choose colors to go with specific ensembles. The necklace attaches at each side, so you can interchange different Vino Buddies(tm). This also allows you to put on your Vino Buddy without having to pull the necklace over your head. Try several for different outfits or occasions!

**THE TEAM**

Vino Buddy(tm) was developed by Tara Paley and Kathryn Sink, two friends who lead a successful wine-lover's group in Long Beach, CA. They often found themselves at parties and other events where it was difficult to hold their wine glass, food or other items all at once. Also, many venues don't always have a lot of space for placing your glass down. The two women created Vino Buddy to add both functionality and fun to any event where wine is served.

Over time, the designs have become more fashionable and unique. Creating them with jewelry pieces such as beads, charms and jewelry wire allow the Vino Buddy to become a personal fashion statement. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.

Today, Kathryn and Tara continue to create new designs based on customer feedback and fashion trends. They truly love creating these pieces and meeting all the wonderful people along the way. Cheers!
